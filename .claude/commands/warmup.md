Prepare for this session by understanding this project's conventions.

Do these in parallel:
1. **Read CLAUDE.md** (check root and src/) if present - these contain project rules
2. **Discover pattern docs** - glob for `PATTERNS_*.md` in `docs/` (don't read them, just note they exist)
3. **Recent context** - `git log --oneline -10`

Summarize briefly:
- What this project does
- Key conventions to follow
- What pattern docs are available (read them when a task needs them, not now)
