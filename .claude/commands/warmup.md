Prepare for this session by understanding this project's structure and conventions.

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** (check root and src/) if present - these contain project rules to follow
2. **Discover pattern docs** - list any `PATTERNS_*.md` or `*_PATTERNS.md` files in `docs/` (don't read them yet, just note they exist)
3. **Quick structure scan** - `tree -L 2 -d` to understand project layout (or `ls` if tree unavailable)
4. **Recent context** - `git log --oneline -10` to see what's been worked on

Summarize (3-5 bullets):
- What this project does
- Key conventions from CLAUDE.md
- What pattern docs are available (so you know where to look later)

When I give you a task, read the relevant pattern doc at that point - not preemptively.
